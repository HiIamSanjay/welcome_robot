Here is the complete guide to installing, running, and turning off your dual-monitor setup.

### Part 1: One-Time Setup (Do this once)

These steps configure the "Ghost Monitor" and prepare the VNC server.

1.  **Configure the Ghost Monitor:**
    Open the terminal and edit the boot file:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt
    ```

    Add this exact text to the very end of the line (do not create a new line):

    ```text
     video=HDMI-A-1:1280x720@60 video=HDMI-A-2:1920x1080@60D
    ```

    *Save and Exit (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl+X`).*

2.  **Disable Wayland (Required for VNC):**
    Open the GDM3 config:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/gdm3/custom.conf
    ```

    Find `#WaylandEnable=false` and remove the `#` so it looks like:

    ```text
    WaylandEnable=false
    ```

    *Save and Exit.*

3.  **Install VNC Server:**

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install x11vnc -y
    ```

4.  **Reboot:**

    ```bash
    sudo reboot
    ```

### Part 2: Running It (Do this every time)

Whenever you want to use your laptop as the second screen:

1.  **On the Raspberry Pi (Start the Server):**
    Run this command to broadcast *only* the Ghost Monitor (Left Screen):

    ```bash
    x11vnc -display :0 -clip 1920x1080+0+0 -forever -shared -noxdamage -ncache 10
    ```

2.  **On Your Laptop (Connect the Viewer):**

      * Open **Remmina**.
      * Select **VNC** protocol.
      * Enter IP: `[Pi_IP_Address]:5900` (e.g., `192.168.1.5:5900`).
      * **Important:** Edit settings and set **Color Depth** to "High Color (16 bpp)" to fix lag.
      * Connect.

-----

### Part 3: Turning It Off

**To stop the session temporarily:**

  * In the Pi terminal running the command, press **`Ctrl + C`**.
  * This stops the broadcast. Your Pi will still "think" it has two screens, so your mouse might still go off the edge into the void.

**To remove the second screen permanently (Revert to Single Monitor):**

1.  Open `cmdline.txt` again:
    ```bash
    sudo nano /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt
    ```
2.  **Delete** the text you added (`video=HDMI-A-1...`).
3.  Save and Reboot. The Pi will return to a normal single-screen setup.
